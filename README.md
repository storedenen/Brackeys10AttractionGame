This is a game made for Brackeys' "Making a game in 10 minutes" challenge.

The game is pretty simple. The player (who is happened to be a planet) needs to attract the meteors (the yellow spheres :)) and make them collide. Meanwhile the player needs to avoid any contact with other objects or the game ends.
